# Structure of Presentation

## Introduction

> You may wish to capture the audience's interest and attention with a story or commentary on a current development that raises an important question / problem / dilemma. Or, you may first wish to **frame your talk with** brief context / background, and then swiftly transition into a concise explantion of the issue / problem or debate that your key message addresses. In either case, **the next step in your introduction is** to clearly state the purpose or key message of the talk, for example using the following prompts. (from: [this](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/writing-assessment/presentations/structuring-your-presentation))


- [ ] frame your talk with brief context / background
- [ ] and then swiftly transition into a concise explantion of the issue / problem or debate that your key message addresses
 - for example using the following prompts
   - 'Today I would like to talk about a highly contested issue...'
   - 'This question is central to understanding...'
   - 'I will make the case that...'

- [ ] state the purpose or key message of the talk



> Most Monte Carlo codes used in Medical Physics research are written in compiled, lower-level languages like FORTRAN or C++.  The original idea of this work consisted in developing a Monte Carlo simulation tool written in the higher level, scripted language Pyhton. This allows for a much more versatile environment to simulate particle transport using the Monte Carlo method, and an opening to the vast opportunities offered by the Python language. 
>
> As such, in this work, a general purpose open-source Python code for the simulation of photon and electron/positron transport has been developed. This code, called MyCo - MONTY CARLO, is innovative, fast, and easy to use. The code’s backbone is mostly written in Cython for computational speed.
>
> For photons and electrons/positrons, most of the data is compiled from the EADL, EPDL and EEDL databases.  The code uses well established models for simulation accuracy, such as the Sternheimer-Liljequist generalized oscillator strength model, a random-hinge condensed history model and an atomic relaxation model based on the EADL vacancy transition probabilities.  
>
> An outline of the program structure is given in the paper, with step by step detailed information about the implementation of the photon and electron transport simulation. 
>
> With this code, photon and electron transport can be easily performed with all the advantages of using Python’s intuitive language without cumbersome compilations and adaptations to different operating systems.

- What is MyCo?
- Why Python?
- Python, how???


## Body

I'm just gonna explain the algorithms!

### Program Structure



### Ray/Sphere Hybrid

### Wilkersons Aliasing

- hey, not everything here needs to be something I invented xd

## Conclusion
